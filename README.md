## Inspiration

We were inspired by video games and the concept of gaining points in order to level up.

## What it does

Provides an incentive for users to be consistent in logging their skincare routine and makes product repurchase quick and easy.

## How we built it

We designed the product in Figma and then built it into a web app using React, SCSS, Framer Motion and Git.

## Challenges we ran into

We ran into some challenges with building certain components due to their complexity alongside adhering to best practises within our code in order to create a feasible MVP.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud of how the web app looks alongside the level of functionality.

## What we learned

We learned how to work effectively as a team and co-ordinate our skillsets for a shared outcome.

## What's next for Skincare Corner 

We want to be able to find more businesses who would benefit from this service in order to increase their customer base. Alongside this, we hope to conduct more research on our initial problem statement.
